# Security & Antivirus Support Case Study

### Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-world malware incident** handled by an **IT Support Technician / Security Analyst**.  
The goal is to demonstrate skills in **malware detection, antivirus scanning, remediation, and user awareness training** using safe testing methods (EICAR test file).


## Objectives
- Detect simulated malware using Windows Defender (EICAR test file)
- Perform full system scans to verify system integrity
- Quarantine and remove the threat
- Document the incident and response steps
- Educate end users on phishing awareness and password safety



## Tools & Technologies Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Windows 11 VM** | Secure environment for testing |
| **Windows Defender** | Antivirus detection and removal |
| **EICAR Test File** | Safe test file to trigger antivirus |
| **Chrome** | Download and web access |
| **Word** | Documentation and user awareness guide |
| **GitHub** | Hosting and portfolio presentation |


## Case Scenario
**Incident ID:** SC-2025-001  
A user reported suspicious pop-ups and slow performance. ,as IT Technician, I investigated the issue, detected a simulated malware (EICAR test file), performed scans, cleaned the system, and provided end-user training to prevent future threats.


##  Steps Performed

### Step 1. Incident Logging
Created an incident ticket to record the case details and initial actions.  
![Incident Ticket](https://github.com/Binali2142/Security-Antivirus-Support-Case-Study/blob/main/Screenshots/01_IncidentTicket.png)  
*Documented the issue reported by user John and assigned it for investigation.*



###  Step 2. Malware Simulation (EICAR Test)
Downloaded the safe **EICAR test file** to simulate a malware infection.

*Windows Defender immediately detected and quarantined the file.*



### Step 3. Threat Detection & Quarantine
Opened Windows Defender, Protection History to confirm the detection.

*Antivirus identified the EICAR test file as a threat and took action.*



### Step 4. Full System Scan
Performed a **Full Scan** using Windows Defender to ensure no remaining threats.

*System scan confirmed the machine is clean.*



### Step 5. Remediation & Verification
Checked quarantine list and removed the threat completely.

*Verified there are no active threats after remediation.*



### Step 6. User Follow-up & Awareness
Sent a detailed follow-up email to the user explaining what happened and prevention tips.  
![User Email](https://github.com/Binali2142/Security-Antivirus-Support-Case-Study/blob/main/Screenshots/07_EmailToUserfx.png)  
*Communicated resolution steps and shared security recommendations.*


### Step 7. User Awareness Training
Created a one-page guide on phishing, password safety, and safe computing habits.  
![User Awareness Guide](https://github.com/Binali2142/Security-Antivirus-Support-Case-Study/blob/main/Screenshots/8_UserAwareness.png)  
*Delivered security best practices to end users.*



### Step 8 Final Incident Report
Compiled all findings, screenshots, and logs into a formal **Incident Report**.
